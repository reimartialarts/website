<p>Martial arts isn&rsquo;t all about kicking and punching. Violent TV shows and movies
might be responsible for some of the bad rap that the sport gets; in reality,
martial arts will help your child much more than it will hurt.</p>

<p>Whether your kid is bursting with energy or shy in most social situations,
martial arts can go a long way toward developing qualities and habits in your
young ones that can last a lifetime.</p>

<h2 id="discipline">Discipline</h2>

<p>Children today are used to instant gratification, and teaching self-restraint
is often a challenge for parents. No matter which martial art you choose,
one of the central tenets will be a focus on self-discipline, which is important
for developing a strong work ethic and the skills needed to avoid physical
confrontations.</p>

<h2 id="hand-eye-coordination">Hand-eye coordination</h2>

<p>All that kicking, punching, and blocking won&rsquo;t just burn up a lot of energy&ndash;it
will also help to develop your child&rsquo;s coordination. Balance, agility, and focus
are all requirements of a martial arts student&ndash;and the benefits will transfer
to other areas of your child&rsquo;s life.</p>

<h2 id="self-confidence">Self-confidence</h2>

<p>Many martial arts classes invite all age groups, sometimes even adults.
If your child is shy or timid around older children, martial arts classes
can instill confidence that will benefit him or her well into their adult lives.
They will learn how to respect themselves and their peers, and that the size and
shape of the person isn&rsquo;t as important as what&rsquo;s on the inside.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-relax-and-breath">Learn to relax and breath</h2>

<p>In today&rsquo;s busy world, it can be tough to relax. The key to most relaxation
techniques&ndash;just as it&rsquo;s the number one focus of martial arts&ndash;is learning
how to control your breathing. And if you&rsquo;re child can learn how to breathe
correctly during physical exertion and under the pressure of competition,
relaxing the mind and body in other aspects of his or her life will be a cinch.</p>

<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that obesity is a problem for our youth. The problem most parents
come across is finding an activity&ndash;beyond video games or television&ndash;that their
children are excited about. Martial arts can provide the outlet your child will
look forward to. Signing up for three or four classes a week can develop lifelong
habits that&rsquo;ll keep him or her fit and healthy&ndash;just ask Bruce Lee.</p>
