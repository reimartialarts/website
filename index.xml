      <description>Martial arts isn&amp;rsquo;t all about kicking and punching. Violent TV shows and movies might be responsible for some of the bad rap that the sport gets; in reality, martial arts will help your child much more than it will hurt.
Whether your kid is bursting with energy or shy in most social situations, martial arts can go a long way toward developing qualities and habits in your young ones that can last a lifetime.</description>
